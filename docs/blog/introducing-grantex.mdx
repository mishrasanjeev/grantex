AI agents are shipping fast. They book flights, send emails, move money, and deploy code. But here is the uncomfortable truth: most of them operate with all-or-nothing API keys and zero audit trail. If an agent goes rogue, you find out after the damage is done.

We built Grantex to fix that.

## The Problem

OAuth 2.0 was designed for human users clicking "Allow" on a consent screen. It works brilliantly for that. But agents are not humans. They operate autonomously, spawn sub-agents, and chain actions across services. OAuth was never designed for:

- **Agent identity** -- agents need their own cryptographic identity, not borrowed user credentials.
- **Delegation chains** -- a parent agent granting a sub-agent a narrower set of permissions.
- **Action-level auditing** -- knowing exactly what an agent did, not just that it authenticated.
- **Real-time revocation** -- killing a misbehaving agent's access in milliseconds, not minutes.

## The Solution

Grantex is an open protocol (Apache 2.0) that provides all of the above. Every agent gets a DID-based identity. Every permission is a scoped, time-limited grant token (JWT) that a human explicitly approved. Every action is logged in an append-only, hash-chained audit trail. And any grant can be revoked instantly.

Here is what the flow looks like in TypeScript:

```typescript
import { Grantex } from '@grantex/sdk';

const gx = new Grantex({
  apiKey: process.env.GRANTEX_API_KEY,
  baseUrl: 'https://grantex-auth-dd4mtrt2gq-uc.a.run.app',
});

// 1. Register an agent
const agent = await gx.agents.create({
  name: 'travel-booking-agent',
  description: 'Books flights and hotels for users',
});

// 2. Request authorization from a user
const auth = await gx.authorize({
  agentId: agent.id,
  userId: 'user_alice',
  scopes: ['flights:book', 'hotels:search'],
  callbackUrl: 'https://app.example.com/callback',
});
// → redirect user to auth.consentUrl

// 3. Exchange the authorization code for a grant token
const token = await gx.tokens.exchange({
  code: callbackCode,
  agentId: agent.id,
});

// 4. Verify the token before acting
const result = await gx.tokens.verify(token.grantToken);
console.log(result.scopes); // ['flights:book', 'hotels:search']
```

The same flow works in Python, and across every integration we ship.

## What Ships Today

- **Protocol spec v1.0** (final) -- the full specification is public and frozen.
- **TypeScript SDK** (`@grantex/sdk`) and **Python SDK** (`grantex`) -- production-ready.
- **7 framework integrations** -- LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, Vercel AI, OpenAI Agents SDK, Google ADK, and an MCP server for Claude Desktop.
- **CLI** (`@grantex/cli`) -- manage agents, grants, and tokens from your terminal.
- **Enterprise features** -- policy engine, SCIM/SSO, anomaly detection, compliance exports, and Stripe billing.

## Get Started

We believe that as agents become more capable, proper authorization becomes more critical, not less. Grantex is our answer to that challenge.
