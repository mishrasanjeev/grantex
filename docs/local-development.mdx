## Start the stack

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mishrasanjeev/grantex.git
cd grantex
docker compose up --build
```

This starts PostgreSQL, Redis, and the auth service. Two developer accounts are seeded automatically:

| Key | Mode | Use for |
|-----|------|---------|
| `dev-api-key-local` | live | Full consent flow with redirect |
| `sandbox-api-key-local` | sandbox | Skip consent UI — get a `code` immediately |

Verify it's running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
# { "status": "ok" }

curl http://localhost:3001/.well-known/jwks.json
# { "keys": [{ "kty": "RSA", "alg": "RS256", ... }] }
```

## Sandbox mode

Sandbox mode is designed for testing. With a sandbox key, `POST /v1/authorize` returns a `code` in the response body — no redirect required:

```bash
# Authorize + get code in one step
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/v1/authorize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sandbox-api-key-local" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentId":"<id>","principalId":"test-user","scopes":["calendar:read"]}'
# → { ..., "sandbox": true, "code": "01J..." }

# Exchange immediately for a grant token
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/v1/token \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sandbox-api-key-local" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code":"<code>","agentId":"<id>"}'
```

## Developer portal

The **hosted portal** is available at [grantex.dev/dashboard](https://grantex.dev/dashboard) — sign up or enter an API key to manage agents, grants, policies, anomalies, compliance exports, and billing from the browser.

For local development, the auth service also serves a lightweight dashboard at `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`.

## SDK development

```bash
# TypeScript SDK
cd packages/sdk-ts
npm install
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm test            # vitest

# Python SDK
cd packages/sdk-py
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest

# Auth service
cd apps/auth-service
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
```
