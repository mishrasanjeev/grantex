description: "Complete REST API reference for the Grantex Auth Service"
---

The Grantex Auth Service exposes a REST API covering agent registration, authorization flows, token management, audit logging, policy enforcement, anomaly detection, compliance exports, SCIM provisioning, SSO, and billing.

## Base URLs

| Environment | URL |
|------------|-----|
| **Production** | `https://grantex-auth-dd4mtrt2gq-uc.a.run.app` |
| **Local** | `http://localhost:3001` |

## Authentication

Most endpoints require a **Bearer token** in the `Authorization` header. This is your developer API key, obtained via `POST /v1/signup`.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://grantex-auth-dd4mtrt2gq-uc.a.run.app/v1/agents
```

SCIM 2.0 user endpoints use a separate **SCIM Bearer token**, created via `POST /v1/scim/tokens`.

Public endpoints (health, JWKS, consent UI, SSO flow) require no authentication.

## Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Global default | 100 requests/minute |
| `POST /v1/authorize` | 10 requests/minute |
| `POST /v1/token` | 20 requests/minute |
| `GET /.well-known/jwks.json` | Not rate-limited |
