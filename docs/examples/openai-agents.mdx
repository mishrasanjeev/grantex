## What it does

This example demonstrates the `grantex-openai-agents` integration by building scope-enforced tools for the OpenAI Agents SDK:

1. **Register an agent** and obtain a grant token via the sandbox flow
2. **Create scoped tools** using `create_grantex_tool` -- each tool is bound to a specific scope (`calendar:read`, `email:send`)
3. **Invoke tools** directly (in a full Agents workflow, the LLM would select and call these tools)
4. **Demonstrate scope enforcement** -- attempting to create a tool with `account:delete` (a scope not in the grant) raises a `PermissionError`
5. **Inspect the audit trail** to see the logged actions

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Docker** (Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Compose)

## Run

Start the local Grantex stack from the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

In a separate terminal, run the example:

```bash
cd examples/openai-agents
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Expected output

```text
Agent registered: ag_01HXYZ...
Grant token received, grantId: grnt_01HXYZ...
Tools created: read_calendar, send_email

--- Invoking read_calendar ---
Result: {"events": [{"title": "Team standup", "time": "9:00 AM", "query": "today"}, {"title": "Design review", "time": "2:00 PM", "query": "today"}]}

--- Invoking send_email ---
Result: Email sent successfully: "Meeting summary: standup at 9 AM, design review at 2 PM"

--- Testing scope enforcement ---
Scope check blocked unauthorized tool: Grant token does not include required scope "account:delete". Granted scopes: calendar:read, email:send

--- Audit trail ---
  [success] read_calendar — 2026-02-28T12:00:00.000Z
  [success] send_email — 2026-02-28T12:00:01.000Z

Done! OpenAI Agents SDK integration demo complete.
```
