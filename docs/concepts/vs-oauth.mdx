Grantex is built **on top of** OAuth 2.0 — not as a replacement, but as a purpose-built authorization layer for AI agents. This page explains the key differences and when each approach is the right fit.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Dimension | OAuth 2.0 | Grantex |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Identity model** | Human users and client applications | Agents, principals (humans), and developers — first-class entities |
| **Delegation** | Limited — no standard for sub-delegation | Agent-to-agent delegation with depth tracking and parent grant chaining (SPEC §9) |
| **Revocation** | Revoke individual tokens | Revoke grants (all tokens under a grant cascade-revoke), plus principal self-service revocation |
| **Audit** | Not built in — requires external logging | Tamper-evident, hash-chained audit log with compliance exports (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR) |
| **Scope model** | Flat string scopes | Hierarchical scopes with a registry, scope constraints in policies, and time-bound restrictions |
| **Agent-to-agent auth** | Not addressed | Sub-agent delegation with `parentAgt`, `parentGrnt`, and `delegationDepth` JWT claims |
| **Compliance** | Bolted on | Built in — anomaly detection, policy engine, evidence packs |
| **Offline verification** | Requires introspection endpoint | JWT-based with JWKS — verify tokens without network calls |

## When to Use OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is the right choice when:

- You are building **human-facing** login flows (social login, SSO)
- Your application follows the traditional **client → resource server** model
- You need broad ecosystem compatibility with existing OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Okta)
- Agents are **not** part of your authorization model

Grantex does not replace your identity provider. Use OAuth 2.0 / OIDC for authenticating humans, and Grantex for authorizing what agents can do on their behalf.

## When to Use Grantex

Grantex is the right choice when:

- **AI agents** act on behalf of users and need verifiable, revocable permissions
- Agents **delegate** to sub-agents and you need to track the delegation chain
- You need a **tamper-evident audit trail** of every action agents take
- **Compliance** requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR) demand structured evidence of agent activity
- Users need to **review and revoke** agent permissions through a self-service dashboard
- You want **offline token verification** without hitting an introspection endpoint on every request

## Using Both Together

A common architecture is:

1. **OAuth 2.0 / OIDC** handles user authentication (login with Google, Okta, etc.)
2. **Grantex** handles agent authorization (what the agent can do, audit trail, revocation)

```
User ──[OIDC login]──▶ Your App ──[Grantex authorize]──▶ Agent
                                                          │
                                                          ▼
                                                    Sub-Agent (delegated)
```

The Grantex `principalId` maps to your user's identity from the OAuth provider. Your app initiates a Grantex authorization request, the user consents, and the agent receives a grant token scoped to exactly what it needs.
