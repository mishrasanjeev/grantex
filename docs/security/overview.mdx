## Reporting a Vulnerability

<Warning>
Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.
</Warning>

Send a report to **security@grantex.dev** with:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- The affected component(s): `auth-service`, `sdk-ts`, `sdk-py`, `cli`, or `SPEC.md`
- Steps to reproduce or a minimal proof-of-concept
- Any suggested mitigations you have identified

Encrypt sensitive reports with the PGP key at `https://grantex.dev/.well-known/security.asc`.

## Response SLA

| Stage | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Acknowledgement | 48 hours |
| Substantive response | 7 business days |
| Patch (Critical / High) | 30 days from confirmation |
| Patch (Medium / Low) | Next scheduled release |

## Coordinated Disclosure

1. Reporter submits vulnerability to `security@grantex.dev`
2. Triage, reproduce, and confirm within 7 business days
3. Develop and test a fix, keeping the reporter in the loop
4. Publish a patched release and a CVE (if applicable)
5. Reporter is credited (or anonymously, at their choice) in release notes
6. Reporter may publish their write-up 30 days after the patch ships

## Scope

### In scope

| Component | Examples |
|-----------|---------|
| `auth-service` | Token issuance, verification, revocation, delegation |
| `sdk-ts` | Client-side token handling, JWT verify |
| `sdk-py` | Same surface as sdk-ts |
| `langchain` | Scope enforcement, audit callbacks |
| `autogen` | Function registry, scope enforcement |
| `vercel-ai` | Tool scope checks, audit logging |
| `crewai` | Tool scope enforcement |
| `cli` | CLI tool, credential handling |
| `portal` | Developer portal, auth flow, API key handling |
| `SPEC.md` | Protocol design flaws |

### Out of scope

- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (report upstream; let us know so we can track)
- Physical access attacks
- Social engineering
- Denial-of-service attacks against hosted infrastructure
- Findings requiring existing admin credentials with no privilege escalation
- Automated scanner output without evidence of exploitability

## Bug Bounty

We do not currently operate a formal bug bounty programme. Impactful reports are recognized publicly in release notes and on the [Hall of Thanks](https://grantex.dev/security/thanks).
