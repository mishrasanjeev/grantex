| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Prepared by** | Thornfield Assurance Partners LLP |
| **Examination date** | As of February 20, 2026 |
| **Report date** | February 28, 2026 |
| **Trust Service Categories** | Security (CC), Availability (A), Confidentiality (C) |
| **Classification** | Public |
| **Report type** | SOC 2 Type I |

## Opinion

In our opinion, in all material respects:

1. The description fairly presents the System as of February 20, 2026.
2. The controls stated in the description were suitably designed to provide reasonable assurance that the trust service criteria for **Security**, **Availability**, and **Confidentiality** would be achieved.

## System Description

Grantex provides a Delegated Authorization Platform — an open, model-neutral protocol for AI agents acting on behalf of human users. The System enables developers to register AI agents, obtain human-consented authorization grants, issue cryptographically signed grant tokens (RS256 JWTs), revoke grants in real time, and maintain a tamper-evident audit trail.

### Infrastructure

| Component | Technology | Role |
|-----------|------------|------|
| Authorization service | Node.js (Fastify v5) | HTTP API |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 | Persistent store |
| Cache | Redis 7 | Revocation lookups, session nonces |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Testing, CodeQL, dependency review |

### Data Categories

| Category | Sensitivity |
|----------|-------------|
| Developer API keys | High (SHA-256 hashes only) |
| Grant tokens | High (not stored post-issuance) |
| Grant records | Medium |
| Audit log entries | Medium |
| SCIM user data | Medium |
| SSO credentials | High (encrypted at rest) |

## Key Controls

### Security (CC6)

- **API key hashing** — SHA-256 hashes only; plaintext never stored
- **Bearer token auth** — Every endpoint validates via `authPlugin` preHandler
- **Redirect URI pre-registration** — Exact-match validation
- **SCIM credential isolation** — Separate token infrastructure
- **RS256 algorithm pinning** — Hardcoded in all three verification layers
- **Minimum 2048-bit RSA keys** — Enforced at startup
- **Real-time grant revocation** — Immediate Redis + database propagation
- **Cascade revocation** — Atomic recursive CTE
- **JTI replay prevention** — Redis O(1) lookup with database fallback

### Availability (A1)

- **Health check endpoint** — `GET /health` for load balancers
- **Redis-backed revocation** — O(1) hot path, database fallback
- **Stateless service design** — Horizontal scaling without data sync
- **Container-based deployment** — Docker Compose with `depends_on` ordering

### Confidentiality (C1)

- **API key non-persistence** — Returned once at creation, never stored
- **Developer-scoped data isolation** — All queries filtered by `developer_id`
- **Grant token non-storage** — JWTs not persisted, only metadata
- **Redis TTL-based expiry** — Automatic cleanup of revocation records

## Monitoring Controls

- **Anomaly detection** — Five anomaly types, four severity levels
- **Hash-chain integrity verification** — Compliance endpoint validates audit chain
- **174 automated tests** — Run on every CI pipeline execution
- **CodeQL static analysis** — Security and quality queries on every push
- **Dependency review** — Blocks high-severity CVEs and prohibited licences

## Complementary User Entity Controls

1. Developers must store API keys securely and rotate if compromised
2. Developers must supply accurate `principalId` values
3. Developers must register only legitimate redirect URIs
4. Developers must review anomaly alerts and audit exports
5. Self-hosted deployments require developer-managed network controls

## Findings Summary

All findings from the third-party security assessment (Vestige Security Labs) were remediated before the examination date, except GXT-003 (rate limiting), which was subsequently addressed in v0.1.3. No findings affect the suitability of design conclusion.
