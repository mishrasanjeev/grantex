## G-1 — OpenSSL in the auth-service base image has a fixable HIGH advisory

- **Found:** container scan of `apps/auth-service` (2026-09-14).
- **What:** `node:26-alpine@sha256:2d984a15…` ships `libcrypto3` and `libssl3`
  3.5.7-r0, affected by CVE-2026-14456 (fixed in 3.5.8-r0).
- **Fix:** move the pinned base image digest in `apps/auth-service/Dockerfile`
  to a build carrying openssl 3.5.8-r0 or later, rebuild, rescan and drop the
  two entries from `.trivyignore.yaml`.

## G-2 — npm's bundled dependencies in the runtime image have fixable HIGH advisories

- **Found:** container scan of `apps/auth-service` (2026-09-14).
- **What:** the base image's global npm carries `brace-expansion` 5.0.7
  (CVE-2026-14257, CVE-2026-69152), `ip-address` 10.2.0 (CVE-2026-69192) and
  `tar` 7.5.19 (CVE-2026-73566). These are npm's own dependencies, not the
  service's, but they are present in the production image.
- **Fix:** a newer base image, or removing npm from the runtime stage once
  dependencies are installed (the service runs with `node`, not `npm`).

## G-3 — Native TypeScript compiler binary is shipped in the production image

- **Found:** container scan of `apps/auth-service` (2026-09-14).
- **What:** `npm ci --omit=dev` still installs `typescript` and
  `@typescript/typescript-linux-x64` into `/app/node_modules`, pulled in by a
  production dependency (at least `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-grpc`
  references it). The Go-built binary carries ten fixable HIGH advisories in
  its Go standard library and `golang.org/x/text`. The runtime does not need a
  compiler.
- **Fix:** find the dependency path (`npm ls typescript --omit=dev` in
  `apps/auth-service`), then exclude it from the runtime install or prune it in
  the Dockerfile, and drop the ten entries from `.trivyignore.yaml`.

## G-4 — The OAuth agent-grants flow does not validate tools entries in `authorization_details`

- **Found:** adding purpose-bound grants (2026-09-15).
- **What:** `POST /oauth/par` in `apps/auth-service/src/routes/oauth.ts` accepts
  any typed `authorization_details` objects from the client and copies them
  into the consented grant and its access token. A `urn:grantex:tools:v1`
  entry pushed there is not checked. It can carry a purpose outside the
  vocabulary, an unknown key, or duplicate connectors, all of which
  `POST /v1/authorize` refuses and the SDKs' `enforce()` denies. The consent
  page shows such entries only as raw JSON, and `grants.purpose` is not set
  for OAuth grants.
- **Fix:** validate `urn:grantex:tools:v1` entries in the PAR handler with the
  same rules as `apps/auth-service/src/lib/purpose.ts` and the SDK parsers
  (known purpose, connector name, no unknown keys, one entry per connector,
  well-formed `tools` and `caps`). Reject with `invalid_authorization_details`,
  persist the purpose on the grant, and show it on the consent page.

## G-6 — mcp-auth uses the OAuth client id as the Grantex principal

- **Found:** `@grantex/mcp-auth` 3.0 work (PRD G-7), 2026-09-15.
- **What:** `startUpstreamAuthorization` in
  `packages/mcp-auth/src/endpoints/authorize.ts` calls `grantex.authorize`
  with `userId: client_id` (unchanged from 2.x). Every person who authorizes
  through one MCP client gets grants for the same principal, and a
  metadata-document client's id is a public URL shared by every
  installation. `/revoke` also relies on it (`sub` must equal the
  authenticated client), and grant lists or audit by principal cannot tell
  people apart.
- **Fix:** establish the person's identity during the consent step (host
  authentication hook or the Grantex consent result) and pass it as the
  principal; change the revocation ownership check to use the grant's client
  binding rather than `sub`.

## G-7 — mcp-auth `/revoke` hides upstream revocation failures

- **Found:** `@grantex/mcp-auth` 3.0 work (PRD G-7), 2026-09-15.
- **What:** `packages/mcp-auth/src/endpoints/revoke.ts` catches and ignores any
  error from `grantex.tokens.revoke` (RFC 7009 lets it answer 200). 3.0 records
  the revocation in its own storage first, so this server and middleware
  sharing that storage refuse the token, but Grantex and every other verifier
  may still accept it, and nothing logs or counts the failure.
- **Fix:** log the failure with the `jti` and a reason code, count it, and
  retry the upstream revocation from a durable queue until it succeeds.


## G-15 — SSO ID-token verification does not refresh the JWKS for an unknown `kid`

- **Found:** decision grants (PRD G-3), 2026-09-15.
- **What:** `verifyIdToken` in `apps/auth-service/src/lib/sso.ts` caches an
  identity provider's JWKS for one hour and only refetches when the cache is
  older than that. A token signed with a key the provider rotated in within
  the hour fails verification until the cache expires, so SSO logins fail
  (closed) after a provider key rotation. The decision-grant approver sign-in
  has its own verification with a rate-limited refetch and is not affected.
- **Fix:** on a `kid` not in the cached set, refetch once, rate-limited by a
  cooldown (as `createRemoteJWKSet` and the Python SDK's JWKS cache do), and
  add a test with a rotated provider key.

## G-16 — SSO discovery does not check the issuer, and ID tokens are checked against the discovered issuer

- **Found:** review of decision grants (PRD G-3), 2026-09-15.
- **What:** `discoverOidcProvider` in `apps/auth-service/src/lib/sso.ts` accepts
  any `issuer` in the discovery document fetched from an SSO connection's
  `issuer_url`, and `verifyIdToken` then verifies `iss` against
  `discovery.issuer` rather than the configured `issuer_url`. OpenID Connect
  Discovery 1.0 section 4.3 requires the two to be identical. A discovery
  document served from the configured host can therefore name another issuer
  whose tokens SSO login accepts. Decision grants do not use this code (their
  approver sign-in checks the issuer itself), but SSO login does.
- **Fix:** refuse a discovery document whose `issuer` differs from the
  configured `issuer_url`, verify `iss` against the configured value, and add
  tests for both.
